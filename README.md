# SciOx ESP32-based Project 2025

This is to support the Creative Coding activity at Science Oxford in early 2025.
The 5 month making experience allows for some cool and relatively complex things to be produced, 2024's was a microbit-based robot.

* an ESP32
* a bunch of sensors, to be decided 
	* this one is using 2x DS18B20s on a single pin
* an LCD, which shows
	* IP address
	* alternately GC mem_free, and sensor output
* a webserver, with all the html/js/css loaded on to the ESP32
* one or more Buttons, which could include
	* change the display
	* reset everything
